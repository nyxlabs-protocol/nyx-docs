# Nyx Labs Protocol

Nyx is a privacy-first infrastructure protocol for Web3.

This repository contains public documentation, architecture overviews, and roadmap updates for the Nyx protocol.

> Core protocol implementation remains private during Stage 1 hardening.

---

## Vision

Nyx is building foundational privacy infrastructure designed to:

- Shield on-chain transactions
- Enable confidential asset transfers
- Support scalable zero-knowledge proofs
- Provide modular privacy primitives for Web3 applications

---

## Current Status

Stage 1 — Core hardening and optimization in progress.

Focus areas:
- Merkle tree depth scaling
- Circuit constraint optimization
- Gas efficiency benchmarking
- Test coverage expansion

---

## Architecture Overview

Nyx core components include:

- Merkle tree commitments
- Noir circuits + verifier contracts
- Shielded pool contracts (deposit / withdraw)
- Proof generation benchmarking layer

---

## Roadmap

- Stage 1: Core hardening (private)
- Stage 2: Infrastructure expansion
- Stage 3: Public testnet release
